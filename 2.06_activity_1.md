# 2.06 Activity 1

Keep working on the `bank` database.

In the `loan` table (which is part of the `bank` database), there's column status A, B, C, and D. Using the `case` statement we will create a new column with the values there with a brief description:

- 'A' : 'Good - Contract Finished'
- 'B' : 'Defaulter - Contract Finished'
- 'C' : 'Good - Contract Running'
- 'D' : 'In Debt - Contract Running'
